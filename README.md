# Northwestern University - ESP 32 Bluetooth code repository project

This is a repository for an IEEE project developed by a team at Northwestern University focusing on Espressif's [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32/overview) microcontroller.

Essentially, the goal of the project is to make it so that ESP 32s periodically scan the area around them for all Wifi-enabled devices, and then upload their MAC addresses to [ThingSpeak](https://thingspeak.com/) for further processing.

This is a work in progress. Stay tuned. ðŸ™‚
